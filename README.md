## 🔍 What’s the Tea?

So, I found this lowkey fire dataset on **Kaggle** (obvi 😎) and I was like:

> “Bet. Let’s unpack this and see what’s poppin’ on the Play Store.”

Next thing you know — 💥 this dashboard was live and serving looks with:

* 📥 **167.6 Billion+ installs** (yes, with a “B” — go big or go home)
* 🧮 **10.8K+ apps** in the mix
* 🎮 Top genres, high-key best-rated apps, most downloaded — all visualized like a pro
* 🏆 Who’s slaying in the ratings? I gotchu.
* 📊 Genre-wise installs, reviews, content ratings — all in one vibe
* 📶 Free vs Paid showdown (spoiler alert: free apps are the main character fr)

## 💡 Hot Takes (aka The Cool Insights)
